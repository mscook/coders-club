Sphinx for rad documentation
============================

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful 
documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.

It was originally created for the new Python documentation, and it has 
excellent facilities for the documentation of Python projects, but C/C++ 
is already supported as well, and it is planned to add special support for 
other languages as well.

**Sphinx makes documenting your code easy. Documenting bioinformatics code is
important**
