Git
===

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.


About git
---------

GIT is a tracks content such as files and directories.

The history of your project is stored in a commit object. Every time you make
a modification you have to commit it. The commit file keeps the author,
committer, comment and any parent commits that directly precede it.

**"One file multiple versions"**

This is bad::

    $ ls project 
    x_0.1.py, x_0.2.py x_0.3.py x_0.4.py x_0.n.py

This is good (under git)::
    
    $ ls project
    x.py (.git)


Example time
------------

Walk through of examples:
    * code.py (initialisation, ignoring staging, commiting, branching)
    * sequence.fa (a biological example, github)
