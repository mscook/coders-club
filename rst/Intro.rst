reStructuredText
================

About
-----

(this document is written in reStructuredText)

reStructuredText is an *easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext 
markup syntax and parser system*. It is useful for in-line program 
documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web 
pages, and for standalone documents.

**reStructuredText (extension rst) is like wiki markup**


Why use it?
-----------

I (and lots and lots of others) use it as:
    * Word sucks (only need a text editor/teminal)
    * Works with Python (emded within code)
    * Can be converted to html, pdf & others
    * GitHub likes it... (well sort of they like Markdown .md more but it's a
      Ruby thing)
    * Can be marked up using tools such as sphinx (next section)
    * ...
